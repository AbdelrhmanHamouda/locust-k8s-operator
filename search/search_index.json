By design, the entire system is cloud native and focuses on automation and CI practices.

It is capable of generating a significant amount of load specially when configured correctly. That being said, there is only so much a single instance and vertical scaling can do. Luckily, Locust has a native out of the box support for distributed mode. This Locust Kubernetes Operator project leverage this feature and adds systems and functionalities to address challenges and situations that are exclusive to the cloud context.</p> <p>Low barrier of entry: Utilizing the power of the Operator lowers significantly the barrier of entry to run in the cloud. From an end-user perspective, running a performance test in the cloud becomes a single command operation.</p> <p>Test isolation and Parallel tests: By default, the Operator is able to support any number of Parallel test executions with an absolute guarantee that each test is fully protected from being polluted by the existence of any number of other tests.</p> <p>Automation &amp; CI: By having automation as a core focus point, teams and organizations can build performance testing directly into CI/CD pipelines. Meaning that every new service, feature or system can be potentially tested and validated for performance SLOs / SLAs.</p> <p>Separation of concerns: By using the Operator, engineering teams can focus on building a robust performance test/s and SREs DevOps teams can focus on managing the resources.</p> <p>Governance: Enable organizations to have governance over what / how resources are deployed and run on the cloud.</p> <p>Cloud cost optimization: Using the Operator enables for a more effective control over the cloud cost. Since resources are only deployed when needed and only for as long as needed, the cost of performance testing is kept to a minimum.</p> <p>Observability: For both engineering teams and cloud admins, the Operator unlocks the ability to build observability &amp; monitoring dashboards in order to analyse test results during test runtime or retroactively (interesting for teams) and infrastructure usage and resource monitoring ( interesting for cloud admins, SREs, etc...).</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#whom-is-it-for","title":"Whom is it for","text":"<p>It is built for...</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#where-can-it-run","title":"Where can it run","text":"<p>Due to its design, the Operator can be deployed on any kubernetes cluster.

Thus, no special setup is needed for the purposes of performance testing with the Operator.

For that end, the Operator have an out-of-the-box support for MSK. </p> <p>To enable performance testing with MSK, a central/global Kafka user can be created by the \"cloud admin\" or \"the team\" responsible for the Operator deployment within the organization. The Operator can then be easily configured to inject the configuration of that user as environment variables in all generated resources.
