### Preface

If you're willing to contribute your ideas and effort to making the _locust-k8s-operator_ better, then that's awesome and I'm truly
grateful. I don't have all the answers and it is important for this project to benefit from diverse perspective and technical expertise.

That being said, please be aware that a lot of thought has gone into the architecture of the project, and whilst I know it's not perfect,
and I am very interested in alternative perspectives, I do have opinions (reasonable I hope) about how certain things should. This
particularly applies to naming and internal APIs. There is a lot to consider in terms of making sure the tool stays simple, flexible, and
performant. So please don't be offended if there is some push back. It is ultimately for the benefit of the tool and nothing more.

### General
