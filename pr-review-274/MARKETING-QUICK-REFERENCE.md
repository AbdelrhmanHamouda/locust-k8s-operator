Key Insights

The Official Operator is Vulnerable:
- 1 GitHub star vs your 65 stars
- 1 documentation page vs your 20+ pages
- Zero troubleshooting, FAQ, security guide vs your comprehensive coverage
- Explicitly "not supported by maintainers" vs your production-proven AWS EKS history

Strategic Advantage:
- You're the original implementation (2022) that inspired the official project
- Zero marketing noise around official operator = opportunity to own the narrative
- Users who research thoroughly will choose you; users who try official will get frustrated and search for
  alternatives (finding you)

Technical Improvements Identified:

Stack additions:
- Material features now free (Nov 2025) - minify, optimize, mike versioning
- Enable instant navigation (40-60% perceived speed boost)
- Typography improvements (75ch line width, consistent spacing)

Architecture fixes:
- Current: 3-4 level depth (overwhelming)
- Recommended: Shallow 2-level with hub homepage (Evaluator, New User, Power User paths)
- Move comparison.md to Getting Started (evaluators find it in <30 seconds)

Content gaps to fill:
- Changelog & release notes (table stakes missing)
- Performance benchmarks (technical credibility)
- Video walkthroughs (differentiation - only 27% of tech writers do this)
- Known limitations page (trust through honesty)

Watch Out For

Critical pitfalls to avoid:
1. Over-simplification - Fix dense docs with formatting/structure, not cutting depth
2. Link breakage - 301 redirects for EVERY URL change
3. Navigation degradation - Keep high-traffic content accessible (1-2 clicks max)
4. Readability traps - WCAG compliance before launch
5. Competitive over-selling - Use objective data, honest tradeoffs
